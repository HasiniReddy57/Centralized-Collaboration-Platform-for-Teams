This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

```

## Usage
You can start editing the application by modifying files in the `pages/` directory. The application supports hot reloading, so changes will be reflected in the browser automatically.

## API Routes
API routes can be accessed at:
```
http://localhost:3000/api/hello
```
You can modify the API endpoint by editing `pages/api/hello.js`.

## Technologies Used
- **Next.js:** React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation.
- **JavaScript:** Core programming language.
- **CSS:** Styling for the application.
